README for AMAT Client

The AMAT client runs as a daemon.  It is written in Python.
So it is called amatd.py

If sent SIGHUP, it will re-read its config file and re-register itself
with the new parameters and go back to regular checkins.

If sent SIGTERM, it will fold up its wings and die more or less gracefully.
